Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold

And look forward to my growing old
To grow is to change, to change is to be new
To be new is to be young again
I barely remember when

My memories are stolen by the morning
Blotted out by the sun's hypnotic light
Out by the sun's hypnotic light

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold



今日是余生之初
我睁开孩童般的双眼
注视着这世界前进的脚步
张开帝王蝶的羽翼
怀着出生的好奇
希翼怀揣勇气
穿过阴冷潮湿的险境
我渴望老去
因为成长意味着改变
改变意味着新生
而新生意味着青春重返
而那
是我几乎遗忘的时光
```
