```
Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold

And look forward to my growing old
To grow is to change, to change is to be new
To be new is to be young again
I barely remember when

My memories are stolen by the morning
Blotted out by the sun's hypnotic light
Out by the sun's hypnotic light

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold
